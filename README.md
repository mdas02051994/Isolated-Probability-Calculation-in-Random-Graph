# Isolated-Probability-Calculation-in-Random-Graph

# Description  
○ Design and implemented algorithm for computing isolation probability using Python.  
○ Used NumPy for multidimensional array.  
○ Applied Matplotlib for the visualization purpose.  
○ Used NetworkX library for generating random graphs.  


## Installation:
First open cmd and run following comand.
```bash
pip install jupyter notebook
```

The installation is slow and change the source of pip to the domestic source.  
Jupyter notebook will pop up a page.

Upload the file with the .ipynb suffix first and after uploading press play button.
